Flare 2026 CSS entry point that loads all layers and defines layer order

This stylesheet targets evergreen browsers and Safari 15.6+.

Safari 15.6 doesn't support several modern CSS features, notably:

- Nested CSS rules (not supported until Safari 16.5+)
- Color functions like light-dark() (not supported until Safari 17.5+)

For a full list of unsupported CSS features in Safari 15.6, see:

https://caniuse.com/?compare=safari+15.6&compareCats=CSS

For more information about browser support targets, see:
